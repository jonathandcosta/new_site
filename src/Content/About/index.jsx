        My professional career began in 2009 as a salesperson, where I gained
        experience in all stages of the sales process, from{' '}
        <span>
          prospecting and qualifying leads (SDR) to scheduling meetings,
          presenting the product and closing the sale
        </span>
        . Over the years, my performance was rewarded with promotions to
        leadership positions, culminating in the position of franchise manager
        in a multinational company, where I led teams and implemented strategies
        that leveraged results in millions of dollars.

        As a result of the pandemic, I reinvented myself and in 2021, I began my
        journey as a Frontend Developer, using my experience in sales and
        leadership to create effective and innovative technological solutions.
        Today, with over 1 year and 8 months of experience in e-commerce
        supervision, I integrate technical and managerial skills to improve
        digital experiences, maximize results and lead projects with excellence.

        management, data and performance analysis, Business Intelligence,
        digital marketing strategies, paid traffic analysis, and efficient
